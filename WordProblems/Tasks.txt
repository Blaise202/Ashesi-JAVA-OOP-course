Task 1
The Ashesi Transportation Fleet Tracker
Scenario
Ashesi is rolling out an internal fleet-tracking system for campus shuttles, security patrol pickups, and maintenance vans.
Your team must design the first phase of the system using inheritance properly.
All vehicles share:
•	a unique ID
•	a driver name
•	a current speed (km/h)
•	the ability to accelerate and brake
Specific vehicles have special behavior:
Bus
•	capacity (number of students)
•	Shuttle accelerates slower than normal vehicles
•	Shuttle braking prints a custom message using super.brake() inside it
Security Patrol Pickup
•	has sirens (boolean)
•	When accelerating, if sirens are ON, it accelerates faster
•	Should override accelerate() and call super.accelerate() appropriately
Maintenance Van
•	stores equipment weight in kg
•	If equipment weight > 200kg, acceleration is reduced
•	Must override accelerate() and use super.accelerate() to calculate base speed first
You must also design a fleet manager class that can store and print all vehicles. The base class and subclasses have been started for you.
 


Task 2
Ashesi Smart Campus Sensor Network
Scenario / Word Problem
Ashesi is deploying a smart sensor network across campus to track activity, utilities, and environmental conditions.
Different sensors share common capabilities but behave differently.
You must use interfaces only, no inheritance.
All sensors must implement:
Interface: Sensor
Variables (constants):
•	int DEFAULT_READING = 0;
•	String CAMPUS_NAME = "Ashesi University";
Methods:
•	int readValue()
•	String getLocation()
•	Default method isCritical() returns false
•	Default method summary() prints the reading and location
Specific capability interfaces:
HasBattery
•	int getBatteryLevel()
•	default method needsCharging() returns battery < 20
Wireless
•	String getSignalStrength()
Concrete Sensors
TemperatureSensor (implements Sensor, Wireless)
•	reading in Celsius
•	location (e.g., "NSE Lab 2")
•	has wireless signal strength
•	reading is critical if above 35°C
WaterFlowSensor (implements Sensor)
•	reading is liters/min
•	reading is critical if < 3
 SecurityCameraSensor (implements Sensor, HasBattery, Wireless)
•	reading indicates motion detections/min
•	has battery level
•	has wireless signal strength
•	critical if battery < 10 OR motion > 20
You must also create a driver program for this. Some starter code has been provided for you.
